-------Statement of problem-------

	In this assignment, you are to provide a solution for the 4-armed bandit problem at the non-associative setting (i.e., four actions at a single state).
In other words, there are four different bags each with a distinct stationary (i.e., balls drawn with replacement) distribution of red, blue and yellow colored balls.
The agent receives a positive reward (i.e., r=1) for the pick of a red ball and no rewards (i.e., r=0) otherwise. If the rewards are noise-free (i.e., the environment
is deterministic) then the rewards for red balls are always positive; a stochastic environment, on the other hand, generates noisy positive rewards, i.e., following a
specific stationary probability distribution, in case of a red ball pick.   The goal for the agent is to maximize the expected total reward. This is possible by
continually drawing balls from the bag with the highest distribution of red balls. We expect that the agentâ€™s selections finally converge to this bag. This will indicate
the agent has successfully learned the correct/optimal policy.
